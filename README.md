# Advent of Code

In this repository, you'll find my responses to the challenges proposed in Advent of Code. The main goal is to practice problem-solving and share the results with the community, so others can benefit from some of my ideas.

The answers are categorized into three levels of resolution:
 - The initial solution that comes to mind, without much concern for performance or readability, written in Python.
 - An optimized solution aimed at reducing execution time or code readability, also written in Python.
 - A solution in another language with which I'm less familiar (C++), based on the optimized Python solution.
