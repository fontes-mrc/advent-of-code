# Advent of Code

In this repository, you'll find my responses to the challenges proposed in Advent of Code. The main goal is to practice problem-solving skills and share the results with the community, so others can benefit from some of my ideas.

## CLI Tool

I've created a CLI tool to help me manage the project. It's a simple Python script that allows me to run the tests and get the status of each day.

```bash
$ python3 aoc.py --help
```

### Get unfo from specific day

```bash
$ docker run --rm -it -v $(pwd):/app -w /app --cpus 1 --memory 128m python:3.12 bash
$ python3 aoc.py info -y 2023 -d 1
```
